Hello everyone!
This is a copy of Medieval Arts right before the 3.0 "Tsars and Despots" update which - along with adding new monuments to the Southern Balkans along with Roads to Power - also retired most non graphical features of this mod, such as Ruins or the Art School.
Due to the vast nature of these changes, the mod as it was the day before release has been posted here. It includes almost all the previous content, plus the new monuments from 3.0 and improvements to the gfx and script. It is up to date with Roads to Power and can be used independently of the actual mod on the Workshop.
These files are free to be used by anybody. You can play it in your new games or in your old saves. You can also introduce parts or all of the previous mechanics of Medieval Arts to your own mods, although I ask for credit to be given in their Workshop pages.

The files are the entire mod (without the .mod file, you'll have to create that yourself). They are divided into three .zip files for ease of use. These are:
1. MA-files: which contains all the "script" and localization parts of the mod
2. MA-3Dart: which contains all the 3D models of monuments
3. MA-2Dart: which contains all the icons and illustrations used by the rest of the game

For any questions feel free to reach out to me on my Discord: https://discord.gg/29EQ72wx
